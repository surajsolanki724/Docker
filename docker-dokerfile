#so guys till now we build image by exist image or build container by exist image but now we create our 
#docker image or container by using dockerfile becouse it provide us to speed or flexibility 
#its a script procedure type 

mkdir Dockerfiles<folder_name>
cd Dockerfiles
vi Dockerfile <its by default docker search here if you want to this name >

'''
FROM image_name:version
'''

#then run docker file its bulid image for you
docker image build -t new_image_name:version    # you see both images id is same becoz file structure not changes
docker image ls  # to list images

#build container
docker container run -it image:version

#again update docker file and add your requirement 
vi Dockerfile <its by default docker search here if you want to this name >

'''
FROM image_name:version   <here you write your base image name >
RUN yum update && yum install net-tools -y  <here you install any software>
RUN touch /tmp/1.txt    # all line containes different layer
RUN touch /tmp/2.txt   #see your layer its update
 #if you modify docker file then alsways add in below

#again build image the see layared architecture
docker image build -t new_image_name:version 

#if you want to give label,workdir, env varible
